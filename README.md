# StudentPerformancePrediction-ML
This is a simple machine learning project using classifiers for predicting factors which affect student grades, using data from CSV file


In this project, a dataset which has students from different nationalities, grade levels and also some determining factors like
number of hands raised, number of attendances, hours studied, etc. is used (provided as a CSV file).


And a few different classifiers and ML models have been used to get the most accurate predictions of which factors,
affect the marks of students.

A few visual aids like graphs and confusion matrix have been created, to show the results.
Also additional heatmaps and other charts have been added to further demonstrate how data modelling and engineering works.
